# NgeeAnn Polytechnic Axis Softball

This website was my idea of allowing both _current players of the team_ and _people who may want to join the team in the future_ to see.
For current players, This website can be a place to go to when they want to _check the CCA schedule_ and a place to _look at each other's performance_, seeing of any of the plays they made during competitions made it to the **Highlights** section of the website. In addition, this website can serve as ***a platform for current players to introduce new players to the team and to the sport***.
For non-current players, this website could be a ***start of an interest they never knew they had***. Hopefully after discovering the website and exploring the website, they become interested in the sport and is keen on joining the team. Through this website, we are able to reach people we never knew and is hopeful on bringing in more people to play the sport of Softball.
 
## Design Process
 
The website will follow the colors of the Axis Softball Logo which is Navy Blue, Yellow and White.
When designing the website, i tried to keep it simple and minimilistic as i think it looked clean and easy to use which caters to anyone, especially people who are new to the sport. Keeping this in mind, i made sure not to make the team and sport not seem very intimidating as from personal experience, that is often times the reason why some people are hesitant to join as the sport seems like a very complicated and difficult to understand sport.
By adding the **About Us** section, it allows the browser to be able to see and know the committee members which hopefully helps them more willing to join as it is often times quite scary to join a team and not know anyone in the CCA therefore, by letting them know who the members are and see their faces they are more likely to join the team.
- As a user myself, i want to be able to go into the website and easyily navigate it without having the confusion of where i am and what certain parts of the website mean. I would also want to be able to see how the team is doing by watching the highlight clips what is shown in the **Highlights** section. Lastly, if i am unsure if there is training on certain dates, i want to be able to rely on this website to be able to give up to date updates on the training schedule.
