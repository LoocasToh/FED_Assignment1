            <h4>About our Training</h4>
            <p>Our training days fall on Mondays and Thursday, where we have normal trainings on Thursdays
                such as fielding drills, batting practice, and sometimes friendly games. Mondays are mostly
                reserved for our very own Ngee Ann Softball League (NPSL).
                NPSL started in 2022 with the intention of creating a more inclusive environment 
                so that everyone would get playing time and also a time for players to have friendly
                rivalry between one another. NPSL has also brought the team closer together as 
                through playing these games every week, everyone gets to know each other better 
                through softball and hence making it easier to befriend one another.
                How it works:
                Players are drafted and traded among the teams before the season starts by the team
                captains so as to ensure fairness in the teams. For Season 1, the team captains were
                    Sarah, Daryl, and Nicholas. For the new season, the team captains are Kayla, Kowin,
                    and Keene.
                We also have a system where all the hits and outs each player gets is recorded in a 
                shared excel sheet so that at any time the players can go into the file to check 
                their teamâ€™s standings and own personal standings in batting and pitching.
