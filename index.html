        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Softball is a sport played by 2 teams of 10 players each who try to score more runs
            than their opponent by rounding bases and crossing home plates as many times as possible.
            With a strong emphasis on extensive teamwork, cooperation and communication between 
            members, softball is ideal for those keen on trying out a new and challenging
            sport. NgeeAnn Axis Softball encourages members to share their experience, 
            knowledge and passion for the sport with fellow softball maniacs.                 Feel free to contact us if you have any queries and have interest in joining
            us!
